Good day,

Welcome to a very simple application.

When you load this application, you will be presented with 10 Pokémon, fetched directly from the PokéAPI, which can be found here; https://pokeapi.co/
There is also a search bar at the top of the page, where you can look for a single Pokémon. If your search matches a Pokémon, it will add it to the list.

At the bottom, you will find a dropdown box and a "Load More" button. Select the amount of additional Pokémon you wish to see (the default is 10) and then click the "Load More" button to see them added to the list. These will begin from the start of the Pokédex.
