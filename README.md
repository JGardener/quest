Good day,

Welcome to a very simple application.

When you load this application, you will be presented with 10 Pokémon, fetched directly from the PokéAPI, which can be found here; https://pokeapi.co/
There is also a search bar at the top of the page, where you can look for a single Pokémon. If your search matches a Pokémon, it will load onto the page and replace the list of Pokémon.

Underneath the list of Pokémon (or the single Pokémon if you searched for one) you will find a dropdown box and a "Load More" button. Select the amount of additional Pokémon you wish to see (the default is 10) and then click the "Load More" button to see that number of additional Pokémon.
