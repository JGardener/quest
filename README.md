Good day,

Welcome to a very simple application.

When you load this application, you will be presented with 10 Pokémon, fetched directly from the PokéAPI, which can be found here; https://pokeapi.co/

Underneath those initial 10 Pokémon, you will find a "Load More" button. Clicking on this will add the next 10 Pokémon to the list each time you click it.
