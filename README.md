Good day,

Welcome to a very simple application.

When you load this application, you will be presented with 10 Pokémon, fetched directly from the PokéAPI, which can be found here; https://pokeapi.co/

Underneath those initial 10 Pokémon, you will find a dropdown box and a "Load More" button. Select the amount of additional Pokémon you wish to see and then click the "Load More" button to see that number of additional Pokémon!
